## Introduction
This post will introduce what I consider the best practices when testing a Django project.
As you've probably read 1000 times, testing is very important because without them, deploying
is pretty much a gamble on whether something is going to break or not.
There are a few different type of tests:

* unit tests: test a specific function, one path at a time (by path I mean if/else conditions)
* integration tests: test a whole user action, from the template to the model
